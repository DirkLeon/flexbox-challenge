            Metroid is a renowned science fiction video game franchise created
            by Nintendo. The series follows the adventures of Samus Aran, a
            powerful bounty hunter equipped with advanced power armor, as she
            explores alien planets and battles hostile creatures known as
            Metroids. First introduced in 1986, Metroid is celebrated for its
            atmospheric exploration, non-linear gameplay, and emphasis on
            isolation. The franchise has evolved over the years, introducing
            innovative mechanics and storytelling elements. With its iconic
            protagonist, memorable alien landscapes, and a unique blend of
            action and exploration, Metroid has left a lasting impact on the
            gaming industry, influencing numerous titles within the adventure
            and action genres.
